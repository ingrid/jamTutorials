    For this tutorial we will be making a simple vertical space shooter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This snippet shows the bare minimum you need to create a game in jam.
  </p>
  <div class="gist" style="width:600px;margin:auto;">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2390157.js"> </script>
  </div>
  <p>
    The first three lines are just telling the page to call our initialization function when it's ready. Within the initialization function, we create a game, and the call Game.run() to set things in motion. The middle line simply adds a border around the game so we can see it (as there is nothing else to see at the moment).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing we'll want to add is the player's ship. Update your initialize function so it looks like this.
  </p>
  <div class="gist">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2390229.js"> </script>
  </div>
  <p>
    We create the sprite objects with the intial coordinates, and set an image for that sprite. Most importantly, we add it to the game. If a sprite isn't added to the game, it won't be drawn.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you might notice, the player can't control his ship yet. To add controls, we need to extend the ship's update function. The player code should now look something like this.
  </p>
  <div class="gist">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2390285.js"> </script>
  </div>
  <p>
    Simple, right? But now the player can move off screen, which is probably not the behaviour you'd want.
